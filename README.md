## Planning Story

The first stage of the planning process was to create a wireframe and an Entity Relationship Diagram for this application.  In this process I was able to set expectations on what I needed to accomplish, along with a realistic timeframe in which to do so.
Next I set up resources and materials I would need in order to complete the project. This consisted of organizing all the materials and setting up documents for quick and easy access, in a flow that would be the best use of my time.
After all these are completed, I then set up my file structure along with any dependencies I would need to get started.  Once they were all ready to go I then created a new repository in which I pushed up the main branch of my application.  Now I was ready to start developing!
