#Record Collection

# Record Collection

This application allows a user to keep track of their record collection in a digital format. This will allow them to create, add and delete their collection and allow them to add comments for each entry.

## Planning Story

The first stage of the planning process was to create a wireframe and an Entity Relationship Diagram for this application.  In this process I was able to set expectations on what I needed to accomplish, along with a realistic timeframe in which to do so.
Next I set up resources and materials I would need in order to complete the project. This consisted of organizing all the materials and setting up documents for quick and easy access, in a flow that would be the best use of my time.
After all these are completed, I then set up my file structure along with any dependencies I would need to get started.  Once they were all ready to go I then created a new repository in which I pushed up the main branch of my application.  Now I was ready to start developing!


### User Stories

- As a user I want to sign in/up
- As a user I want to Create a new album
- As a user I want to search for a single album
- As a user I want to sort the collection
- As a user I want to add comments to the album

### Technologies Used

- html
- css
- Sass
- Ajax
- JSON
- JavaScipt
- Bootstrap
- Handlebars

### Unsolved Problems

- Still need to clean up the styling.
- Would like to add a rating sytem along with personal notes per album. Eventually would like to add photo of the album cover and add google scan to the app for easy web search of that particular album.
